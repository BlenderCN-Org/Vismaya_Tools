# Vismaya_Tools
Fork of the Project Vismaya Tools blender addon

## Evaluating the usability of the Project Vismaya addon as a bridge for new Maya users to cross over to blender.
The addon needs to be moved from the old Tool Shelf to the new Tool Tabs UI configuration.

All the tools in the addon need to be tested to see if they still work since this is an addon designed for earlier versions of blender and python.
